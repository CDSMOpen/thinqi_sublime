* Wants
	* ![](assets/images/mod07_pg15_ass01.jpg){:.sml}
	
		**Wants** are things that it would be **nice to have**, such as friendly service, very high value for money, ease and convenience, or a fully insured loan car with a full tank of fuel.
* Needs
	* ![](assets/images/mod07_pg15_ass02.jpg){:.sml}

		**Needs** are things that the customer **must have**, such as expert and punctual service, faultless repair, reliability, affordability, safety and a trusting relationship with your dealership. 
* Expectations
	* ![](assets/images/mod07_pg15_ass03.jpg){:.sml}

		**Expectations** are born out of our **past experience**, which has a great effect on our current and future perceptions of the things around us.

		![Waiting to Speak](assets/images/mod07_pg41_ass03.jpg){:.sml}

		This isn't really listening, it's just waiting for a pause so that you can have your say. It is not likely to create a good impression on customers.<br>

		This is how we should listen when dealing with customers. Be patient, listen to all that the customer has to say and then, when it is time for you to respond, you can do so with greater knowledge and empathy.

* Item One
	* {:.title} Don't Talk, Listen
	* {:.description}

		It's really difficult to talk and listen at the same time, so don't do it. Focus your whole attention on what the customer has to say.

	* {:.fgImage} ![Image One](assets/images/mod07_pg42_ass02.jpg)

* Item Two
	* {:.title} Show Interest and Understanding
	* {:.description}

		By making effective use of eye contact and body language, you can let your customer know that they have your full attention. Lean towards them to show that you are interested in what they have to say and nod in agreement when necessary, but don't overdo it.

* Item Three
	* {:.title} Review Regularly
	* {:.description}

		When you notice a natural pause in what the customer has to say, use this pause to confirm what has been said. Write down what the customer has said as you are going if necessary, and be prepared to share your notes and scribbles with the customer to confirm understanding.

	* {:.description}

		Recap, confirm and, if necessary, confirm again. Question everything that you are confused by &#8212; but be careful not to anger or upset the customer by challenging them in an aggressive manner.
